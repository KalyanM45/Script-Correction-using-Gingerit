# Script-Correction-using-Gingerit

The "Script Correction" project is a simple application built using the Streamlit framework and the Gingerit library. The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for refining scripts by correcting grammar errors.

When the application is launched, a title "Script Correction" is displayed. Below the title, there is a text input field labeled "Enter Your Script." Users can enter their script into this text field. To initiate the correction process, users need to click the "Refine" button. If the text input field is empty when the button is clicked, a warning message "No Script Written" will be displayed. Otherwise, the Gingerit library is used to parse the text and correct any grammar errors. The corrected version of the script is then displayed in a success message below.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- ```streamlit```: A Python framework for building interactive web applications.
